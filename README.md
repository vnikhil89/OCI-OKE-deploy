# OCI-OKE-deploy

In this blog , i am going to deploy Oracle Kubernetes Engine using Terraform and Resource Manager.

This blog divided into four sections :

1) Prepare Terraform Files for VCN , Kubernetes Cluster and Node Deployment.

2) Prepare schema.yaml to pass all variable options from Resource Manager

3) Then we will prepare resource manager and apply above.

4) Finally we will deploy one sample Application and try to launch from internet.
